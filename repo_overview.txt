NodeNest MERN Stack Project Overview
=====================================

Project Description:
NodeNest is a comprehensive full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) designed for project management and team collaboration. This platform provides a robust foundation for managing projects, tasks, and team members in an efficient and scalable manner.

Architecture:
- Frontend: React 18 with modern hooks, React Router for navigation, React Query for data fetching
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js, RESTful API design
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM for data modeling
- Authentication: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt for password hashing
- Styling: Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive UI design
- State Management: React Context API for authentication, React Query for server state
- Development Tools: Hot reload with nodemon and react-scripts

Key Features:
1. User Management
   - User registration and authentication
   - Profile management with skills and bio
   - Role-based access control (user, admin, project_manager)

2. Project Management
   - Create and manage projects
   - Add/remove team members with roles
   - Project status tracking (planning, in_progress, on_hold, completed, cancelled)
   - Priority levels and progress tracking
   - Technology stack and tags for categorization

3. Task Management
   - Create tasks within projects
   - Assign tasks to team members
   - Task status tracking (todo, in_progress, review, completed, cancelled)
   - Priority levels and time tracking
   - Comments and attachments support
   - Task dependencies

4. Dashboard Analytics
   - Project and task statistics
   - Personal task overview
   - Recent activity tracking

Technical Implementation:
- RESTful API with proper HTTP status codes
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling and logging
- Rate limiting and security headers
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Component-based architecture
- Custom hooks for reusable logic

Database Schema:
- Users: Authentication, profile information, skills
- Projects: Project details, members, status, metadata
- Tasks: Task details, assignments, comments, dependencies

Security Features:
- JWT token-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS configuration
- Security headers with Helmet

Development Setup:
- Docker support with multi-stage builds
- Environment-based configuration
- Hot reload for development
- Production-ready build process
- Comprehensive error handling

Testing Framework:
- Jest for unit and integration tests
- Supertest for API testing
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Test scripts for automated execution

This project serves as an ideal foundation for LLM training tasks, providing:
- Complex codebase with 15+ core files
- Multiple interconnected systems
- Real-world business logic
- Scalable architecture patterns
- Comprehensive testing capabilities
- Docker containerization for consistent environments
