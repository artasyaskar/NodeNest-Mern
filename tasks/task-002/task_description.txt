  Task: Implement Basic Project Management API Endpoints

  Instructions:
  Add 6 fundamental project management endpoints to the Express.js server to support basic project operations.

  1. Add POST /api/projects endpoint to create a new project
  2. Add GET /api/projects endpoint to retrieve list of all projects
  3. Add GET /api/projects/:id endpoint to retrieve specific project by ID
  4. Add PUT /api/projects/:id endpoint to update specific project by ID
  5. Add DELETE /api/projects/:id endpoint to delete project by ID
  6. Add POST /api/projects/:id/tasks endpoint to add task to project

  Background:
  The NodeNest server currently has authentication endpoints and user management endpoints. The frontend application requires basic project management endpoints to enable users to create, manage, and organize projects with tasks.

  Steps:
  1. Add project management endpoints to server/app.js after the existing user routes
  2. Implement mock data responses for each endpoint
  3. Ensure proper JSON response formatting
  4. Add basic parameter handling for ID-based endpoints
  5. Place endpoints before the error handling middleware

  Expected functionality:
  - Create project endpoint should accept project data (name, description, etc.)
  - Projects list endpoint should return array of project objects
  - Project by ID endpoints should handle dynamic ID parameters
  - Update endpoint should accept JSON payload with project data
  - Delete endpoint should return success message
  - Add task endpoint should associate task with project
  - All endpoints should return proper JSON responses

  Technical requirements:
  - Use Express.js routing patterns
  - Implement mock data responses (no database required)
  - Handle route parameters for ID-based endpoints
  - Accept JSON request bodies for POST/PUT endpoints
  - Return consistent JSON response format
  - Place routes before error handling middleware

  Success criteria:
  - All 6 project management endpoints are implemented
  - Tests verify endpoint existence in server code
  - Each endpoint returns proper JSON responses
  - Route parameters are handled correctly
  - Server starts without errors
  - All tests pass after implementation

  Critical tested requirements:
  - POST /api/projects endpoint exists in server code
  - GET /api/projects endpoint exists in server code
  - GET /api/projects/:id endpoint exists in server code
  - PUT /api/projects/:id endpoint exists in server code
  - DELETE /api/projects/:id endpoint exists in server code
  - POST /api/projects/:id/tasks endpoint exists in server code
