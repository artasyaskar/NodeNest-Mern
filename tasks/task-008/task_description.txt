  Task: Implement Comments and Discussion API Endpoints

  Instructions:
  Add 6 fundamental comments and discussion endpoints to the Express.js server to support commenting on projects, tasks, and general discussions.

  1. Add GET /api/comments endpoint to retrieve list of comments
  2. Add POST /api/comments endpoint to create a new comment
  3. Add GET /api/comments/:id endpoint to retrieve specific comment by ID
  4. Add PUT /api/comments/:id endpoint to update specific comment by ID
  5. Add DELETE /api/comments/:id endpoint to delete comment by ID
  6. Add GET /api/comments/resource/:resourceId endpoint to get comments for a specific resource

  Background:
  The NodeNest server currently has authentication, user management, project management, task management, dashboard analytics, notification system, file management, and search endpoints. The frontend application requires comments and discussion endpoints to enable collaboration, feedback, and communication on projects, tasks, and other resources.

  Steps:
  1. Add comments and discussion endpoints to server/app.js after the existing search routes
  2. Implement mock comment data responses for each endpoint
  3. Ensure proper JSON response formatting with comment metadata
  4. Add basic parameter handling for ID-based endpoints
  5. Place endpoints before the error handling middleware

  Expected functionality:
  - Get comments endpoint should return paginated list of comments
  - Create comment endpoint should accept comment data with content, author, etc.
  - Get comment by ID endpoint should return detailed comment information
  - Update comment endpoint should accept JSON payload with comment data
  - Delete comment endpoint should return success message
  - Resource comments endpoint should return comments for specific projects/tasks
  - All endpoints should return proper JSON responses with timestamps

  Technical requirements:
  - Use Express.js routing patterns
  - Implement mock comment data responses (no database required)
  - Handle route parameters for ID-based endpoints
  - Accept JSON request bodies for POST/PUT endpoints
  - Return consistent JSON response format
  - Include proper timestamps and author information
  - Place routes before error handling middleware

  Success criteria:
  - All 6 comments and discussion endpoints are implemented
  - Tests verify endpoint existence in server code
  - Each endpoint returns proper comment data structure
  - Mock data includes realistic comment threads and replies
  - Server starts without errors
  - All tests pass after implementation

  Critical tested requirements:
  - GET /api/comments endpoint exists in server code
  - POST /api/comments endpoint exists in server code
  - GET /api/comments/:id endpoint exists in server code
  - PUT /api/comments/:id endpoint exists in server code
  - DELETE /api/comments/:id endpoint exists in server code
  - GET /api/comments/resource/:resourceId endpoint exists in server code
