  Task: Implement Basic User Management API Endpoints

  Instructions:
  Add 6 fundamental user management endpoints to the Express.js server to support basic user operations.

  1. Add GET /api/users/profile endpoint to retrieve current user profile
  2. Add PUT /api/users/profile endpoint to update current user profile
  3. Add GET /api/users endpoint to retrieve list of all users
  4. Add GET /api/users/:id endpoint to retrieve specific user by ID
  5. Add PUT /api/users/:id endpoint to update specific user by ID
  6. Add DELETE /api/users/:id endpoint to delete user by ID

  Background:
  The NodeNest server currently only has authentication endpoints (/api/auth/register, /api/auth/login) and a health check endpoint. The frontend application requires basic user management endpoints to function properly for profile management and user administration.

  Steps:
  1. Add user management endpoints to server/app.js after the existing auth routes
  2. Implement mock data responses for each endpoint
  3. Ensure proper JSON response formatting
  4. Add basic parameter handling for ID-based endpoints
  5. Place endpoints before the error handling middleware

  Expected functionality:
  - Profile endpoints should return/accept user profile data with firstName, lastName, email, username
  - Users list endpoint should return array of user objects
  - User by ID endpoints should handle dynamic ID parameters
  - Update endpoints should accept JSON payload with user data
  - Delete endpoint should return success message
  - All endpoints should return 200 status codes with proper JSON responses

  Technical requirements:
  - Use Express.js routing patterns
  - Implement mock data responses (no database required)
  - Handle route parameters for ID-based endpoints
  - Accept JSON request bodies for PUT endpoints
  - Return consistent JSON response format
  - Place routes before error handling middleware

  Success criteria:
  - All 6 user management endpoints are implemented
  - Tests verify endpoint existence in server code
  - Each endpoint returns proper JSON responses
  - Route parameters are handled correctly
  - Server starts without errors
  - All tests pass after implementation

  Critical tested requirements:
  - GET /api/users/profile endpoint exists in server code
  - PUT /api/users/profile endpoint exists in server code
  - GET /api/users endpoint exists in server code
  - GET /api/users/:id endpoint exists in server code
  - PUT /api/users/:id endpoint exists in server code
  - DELETE /api/users/:id endpoint exists in server code
