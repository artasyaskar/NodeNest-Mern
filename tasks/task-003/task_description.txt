  Task: Implement Basic Task Management API Endpoints

  Instructions:
  Add 6 fundamental task management endpoints to the Express.js server to support basic task operations.

  1. Add POST /api/tasks endpoint to create a new task
  2. Add GET /api/tasks endpoint to retrieve list of all tasks
  3. Add GET /api/tasks/:id endpoint to retrieve specific task by ID
  4. Add PUT /api/tasks/:id endpoint to update specific task by ID
  5. Add DELETE /api/tasks/:id endpoint to delete task by ID
  6. Add PATCH /api/tasks/:id/status endpoint to update task status

  Background:
  The NodeNest server currently has authentication, user management, and project management endpoints. The frontend application requires basic task management endpoints to enable users to create, manage, and track individual tasks across projects.

  Steps:
  1. Add task management endpoints to server/app.js after the existing project routes
  2. Implement mock data responses for each endpoint
  3. Ensure proper JSON response formatting
  4. Add basic parameter handling for ID-based endpoints
  5. Place endpoints before the error handling middleware

  Expected functionality:
  - Create task endpoint should accept task data (title, description, projectId, etc.)
  - Tasks list endpoint should return array of task objects
  - Task by ID endpoints should handle dynamic ID parameters
  - Update endpoint should accept JSON payload with task data
  - Delete endpoint should return success message
  - Status update endpoint should handle partial updates
  - All endpoints should return proper JSON responses

  Technical requirements:
  - Use Express.js routing patterns
  - Implement mock data responses (no database required)
  - Handle route parameters for ID-based endpoints
  - Accept JSON request bodies for POST/PUT/PATCH endpoints
  - Return consistent JSON response format
  - Place routes before error handling middleware

  Success criteria:
  - All 6 task management endpoints are implemented
  - Tests verify endpoint existence in server code
  - Each endpoint returns proper JSON responses
  - Route parameters are handled correctly
  - Server starts without errors
  - All tests pass after implementation

  Critical tested requirements:
  - POST /api/tasks endpoint exists in server code
  - GET /api/tasks endpoint exists in server code
  - GET /api/tasks/:id endpoint exists in server code
  - PUT /api/tasks/:id endpoint exists in server code
  - DELETE /api/tasks/:id endpoint exists in server code
  - PATCH /api/tasks/:id/status endpoint exists in server code
