  Task: Implement Notification System API Endpoints

  Instructions:
  Add 6 fundamental notification system endpoints to the Express.js server to support user notifications, alerts, and messaging.

  1. Add GET /api/notifications endpoint to retrieve user notifications
  2. Add POST /api/notifications endpoint to create a new notification
  3. Add PUT /api/notifications/:id/read endpoint to mark notification as read
  4. Add DELETE /api/notifications/:id endpoint to delete notification
  5. Add GET /api/notifications/unread/count endpoint to get unread notification count
  6. Add PUT /api/notifications/mark-all-read endpoint to mark all notifications as read

  Background:
  The NodeNest server currently has authentication, user management, project management, task management, and dashboard analytics endpoints. The frontend application requires notification system endpoints to keep users informed about important updates, task assignments, project changes, and system alerts.

  Steps:
  1. Add notification system endpoints to server/app.js after the existing dashboard routes
  2. Implement mock notification data responses for each endpoint
  3. Ensure proper JSON response formatting with notification metadata
  4. Add basic parameter handling for ID-based endpoints
  5. Place endpoints before the error handling middleware

  Expected functionality:
  - Get notifications endpoint should return paginated list of user notifications
  - Create notification endpoint should accept notification data with type, message, etc.
  - Mark as read endpoint should update individual notification status
  - Delete endpoint should remove notification permanently
  - Unread count endpoint should return integer count of unread notifications
  - Mark all read endpoint should update all notifications for user
  - All endpoints should return proper JSON responses with timestamps

  Technical requirements:
  - Use Express.js routing patterns
  - Implement mock notification data responses (no database required)
  - Handle route parameters for ID-based endpoints
  - Accept JSON request bodies for POST/PUT endpoints
  - Return consistent JSON response format
  - Include proper timestamps and status fields
  - Place routes before error handling middleware

  Success criteria:
  - All 6 notification system endpoints are implemented
  - Tests verify endpoint existence in server code
  - Each endpoint returns proper notification data structure
  - Mock data includes realistic notification types and timestamps
  - Server starts without errors
  - All tests pass after implementation

  Critical tested requirements:
  - GET /api/notifications endpoint exists in server code
  - POST /api/notifications endpoint exists in server code
  - PUT /api/notifications/:id/read endpoint exists in server code
  - DELETE /api/notifications/:id endpoint exists in server code
  - GET /api/notifications/unread/count endpoint exists in server code
  - PUT /api/notifications/mark-all-read endpoint exists in server code
